# Power-Bi-Adventure-works-dashboard
 The Power BI project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing sales data of a retail company. 
The dashboard will include visualizations such as sales trends, revenue breakdown by product, and customer segmentation. The project will utilize data from various sources, including the company's CRM and sales database.
The Power BI project involved creating a dashboard to analyze and visualize customer behavior for an e-commerce company. The project required extensive use of DAX formulas, data modeling, and visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights to the business.

To begin with, we imported data from various sources, including the company's website and sales database, into Power BI. We then used DAX formulas to create measures such as customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, and average order value. These measures were critical in understanding the customer behavior and making strategic business decisions.

Next, we created a robust data model that allowed us to drill down into the data at various levels, from customer segment to individual transactions. The data model facilitated the creation of powerful visualizations such as a customer journey map and a sales funnel. These visualizations provided a comprehensive view of the customer experience, from awareness to purchase, and helped identify opportunities for improvement.

Finally, we built a user-friendly dashboard that allowed the business stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights easily. The dashboard included interactive visualizations that allowed users to slice and dice the data based on various parameters. The project successfully delivered valuable insights to the business and enabled data-driven decision-making.
